\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my parents Cari Beck and Tom Beck who have made it possible for me to receive an incredible education in something I love. I appreciate everyone who has been a part of my life at Linfield College, such as my friends from the first week of freshman year: Rosa Johnson, Alex Andreotti, Andrew Free, Emily Culley, and those who came later such as Sarah Becker, Kyle Sharrer, and many more. To all who I have spent countless hours working on physics assignments with in Graf Hall. Most importantly, my supportive professors in the Linfield College Physics Department: Dr. Michael Crosser, Dr. Jennifer Heath, Dr. Bill Mackie, Dr. Joelle Murray, and Dr. Tianbao Xie. With all these people and many more, they have become a part of my Linfield family.
